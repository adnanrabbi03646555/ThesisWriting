\section{The Grammar of Annotation Language:}

\section{UML State Chart Editor:}
UML state chart editor has been extended based on the open source Yakindu SCT [21]framework. The existing language grammar with
annotation language grammar has extended in order to support new set
of tags. Furthermore, an annotation proposal filter implemented which was used to filter out the annotation language tags of the Yakindu SCT language grammar.

\section{Source Code Editor:}
The source code editor has extended which offers annotation language proposals which are context sensitive with respect to the position of the currently edited syntax line.Editor suggestions work only if the whole file is parsed without errors.

\section{C Code Generator:}
C code generator has extended based on Eclipse EMF and xTend which is used to generate the state chart execution code containing the previously added security annotations from UML state charts. The code generator outputs two files per UML state chart (one .c and one
.h file). Generated annotations can reside in both header file
and source code file. Previously annotated UML state chart
states are converted to either C function calls or C variables
declarations, both have been previously annotated. We use
the available state chart execution flow functionality which is
responsible for traversing the UML state chart during state
chart simulation. The UML state chart will be traversed by the code generation algorithm and code is generated based on
the mentioned state chart execution flow. The generated code
will contain at least one bad path (contains a true positive) and
a good path (contains no bug) per UML state chart if those
paths were previously modeled inside the UML state chart.
