\chapter{Limitations}
The main limitations of this system are given below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item In UML state chart user can design function calls and statements of C/C++ language.
	
	\item Currently user have to model a real life system using region name good\_path() and bad\_path() or one of them in UML state chart editor. Otherwise code generator will not work.
	
	\item Now code generator generates only two files. One is .c file and another one is .h file.
	
	\item Code generator works with YAKINDU SCT editor.
	
	\item Static analysis engine works only in Ubuntu operating system.
	
	\item Code generator, UML statechart modeling developed in windows operating system.
	
	\item The simulation is not currently not working in selected scenarios in UML state chart editor.
	
	\item Now source, sink, authentication, declassification and santization types of function can be annotated.
