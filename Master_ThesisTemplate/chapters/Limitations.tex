\chapter{Limitations}
The main limitations of this system are given below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Function calls and statements are possible to model in state chart editor:} Now in UML state chart user can model function calls and statements like variable declaration of C/C++ language. But it is not possible to model switch-case statements, loops etc. In future it may be included.
	
	\item \textbf{Region names are fixed:} Currently user have to model a real life system using region name good\_path() and bad\_path() or one of them in UML state chart editor. Otherwise code generator will not work.
	
	\item \textbf{Generator generates two files:} Now code generator generates only two files. One is .c file and another one is .h file.
	
	\item \textbf{Generator included inside YAKINDU SCT editor:} Code generator works with YAKINDU SCT editor.
	
	\item Static analysis engine works only in Ubuntu operating system.
	
	\item \textbf{Bindings with operating system:}  Code generator, UML statechart modeling developed in windows operating system. Both of these are now working only in windows operating system.
	
	\item \textbf{Simulation not working:} The simulation of UML statechart is not currently working in selected scenarios in UML state chart editor.
	
	\item \textbf{Fixed function names:} Now source, sink, authentication, declassification and santization types of function can be annotated.
