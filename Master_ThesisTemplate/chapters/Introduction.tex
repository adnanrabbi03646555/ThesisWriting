The detection of information flow vulnerabilities uses dynamic analysis techniques , static analysis techniques and hybrid techniques which combine static and dynamic approaches. The static techniques need to know when to use  sanitization , declassification and authentication functions.
A solution for tagging sanitization, declassification and authentication in source code is based on libraries which contain all needed annotations attached to function declarations. This approach plays an important role mainly for static analysis bug detection techniques where the information available during program run-time is not available nor the interaction with the environment can be fully simulated.
Extended Static Checking (ESC) is a promising research area which tries to cope with the shortage of not having the program run-time information. During extended static analysis additional information is provided to the static analysis process. This information can be used to define trust boundaries and tag variables. Textual annotations are usually manually added by the user in source code. At the same time annotations can be automatically generated and inserted into source code . ESC can be used to eliminate bugs in a late stage of the software project when code development is finished. Tagging and checking for information exposure bugs during the design phase would eliminate the potential of implementing software bugs which can only be removed very costly after wards. Thus security concerns should be enforced into source code right after the conceptual phase of the project.
The paper presents five challenges concerning ESC. The last challenge reports of the annotation as being a very time consuming burden and is therefore disliked by some programming
teams. The authors argue about the fact that annotations can cover design decisions and enhance the quality of source code. We argue that annotations are necessary in order to do ESC and the user needs a kind of assistance tool that helps selecting the suited annotation based on the current context. Thus the annotation burden needed for learning and applying the language should be reduced. At the same time adding annotations to reusable code libraries reduces even more the annotation burden since libraries can be reused, shared and changed by software development
teams.\\

Information flow errors in UML models
and code are introduced by software designers or programmers
who are sometimes blind with respect to the fact that they
are trained to focus point-wise (one code line and one data flow
at a time). This is why it is important to develop techniques
and tools which can detect this type of errors before they
materialize in production code.Information flow vulnerabilities are hard to detect because static code analysis techniques need previous knowledge about what should be considered a security issue. Code annotations which are added mainly during software development [6] can be used to provide additional knowledge regarding security
issues. On the other hand code annotations can increase the
number of source code lines by 10% [27]. In order to detect
information flow vulnerabilities software artifacts have to be
annotated with annotations attached to public data, private data and to system trust boundaries. Next, annotated artifacts have
to be made tractable by tools which can use the annotations
and check if information flow constraints hold or not based on
information propagation techniques.\\

The detection of information flow vulnerabilities in code
and UML state charts is not well addressed and is particularly
challenging. Foremost, there is no common annotation language for annotating UML state charts and source code with
information flow security constraints such that errors can be
detected also when code is not available. Second, there are
no automated checking tools which can reuse the annotated
constraints in early stages of software development to check
for information flow errors. We think that it is important to
specify security constraints as early as possible in the software
development process in order to avoid later costly repairs or
exploitable vulnerabilities.
