I would like to express my deepest appreciation to all those who provided me the possibility to complete this thesis. A special gratitude and thanks I give to my supervisor Prof. Dr. Claudia Eckert and my advisor, MSc. Paul Muntean, whose guidance, stimulating suggestions and encouragement, helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis. Without their cooperation in the last 6 months, this thesis could not be done smoothly.\\ \\
Last but not the least, I wish to thank my family for their support and encouragement throughout my Master study.
